# Monify

Monify is a personal finance application designed to help users track and manage their financial programs. Built as my first experience with Flask, Monify showcases my initial dive into full-stack development, combining backend logic with user-friendly frontend design.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Secure user authentication to manage personal financial data.
- **Program Management**: Users can create, update, and delete custom financial programs.
- **Calculator Tool**: A built-in calculator that allows users to compute values and use amounts from their saved programs.
- **CoreData Integration**: Efficient data storage and management for seamless program tracking.
- **Intuitive UI**: A clean and professional interface for easy navigation.
- **SwiftUI App**: A connected app version using SwiftUI to provide a cohesive experience across platforms.

## My First Works with Flask
Monify marks my first venture into using Flask for web development. Through this project, I learned to:
- Set up Flask applications with routing and template rendering.
- Create and manage forms with Flask-WTF.
- Implement authentication and user session management.
- Design and connect a frontend interface with backend logic.
- Handle data persistence using CoreData for the app side.

## Why Monify?
The idea behind Monify came from wanting to simplify financial tracking and make it more interactive. The project helped me develop a deeper understanding of backend frameworks and taught me how to integrate functionalities across platforms, from web to mobile apps.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monify.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
```bash
cd monify
```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the Flask Application:**
```bash
flask run
```

## Future Plans
- Enhance the UI for a more dynamic experience.
- Add advanced financial analytics features.
- Optimize cross-platform data syncing between the web and SwiftUI app.
